An Arithmetic Progression is defined as one in which there is a constant difference between the consecutive terms 
of a given series of numbers. You are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic Progression. There is 
however one hitch: exactly one or more term from the original series is missing from the set of numbers which have 
been given to you. The rest of the given series is the same as the original AP. Find the missing terms.


You have to write the function find_the_missing(list), list will always be at least 3 numbers. The missing term 
will never be the first or last one.


find_the_missing([1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13,17]) == [7, 15]
